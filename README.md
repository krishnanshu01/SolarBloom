Objective
---------

The objective of SolarBloom is to create a highly efficient solar tracking system that mimics the motion of sunflowers to optimize solar energy capture. By integrating azimuth angle data from the SunCalc website and real-time sensor feedback, SolarBloom aims to train a model that will accurately predict the optimal panel orientation for maximum energy absorption. The end goal is to enhance solar energy efficiency while eventually eliminating the need for physical sensors, simplifying the system and minimizing maintenance.
--------------
Implementation
--------------

SolarBloom is implemented in several phases:

1.  Design and Data Collection:
    The system utilizes a dual-axis tracking mechanism equipped with servo motors controlled by an Arduino microcontroller.
    Initial data collection involves both real-time azimuth data from the SunCalc website and sensor input (LDRs) to monitor sunlight intensity and calculate error margins.

2.  Model Training:
    The collected sensor data and azimuth readings are used to train a machine learning model. This model learns to predict the optimal positioning of the solar panels based on historical data, environmental conditions and location.
    The trained model gradually takes over the task of aligning the solar panels, reducing reliance on real-time sensor input.
3.  Transition to Sensor-Free Operation:
    Once the model achieves 90-95% of accuracy, sensors can be removed from the system, streamlining the design and lowering potential points of failure.

Final Result
------------

Upon successful implementation, SolarBloom will be a trained, predictive solar tracking system capable of adjusting panel positions without sensor feedback, maintaining high efficiency. This evolution marks a significant step forward in renewable energy technology, offering a smarter, less complex solution for solar tracking.
